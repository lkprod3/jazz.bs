## Jazz & Blues (name subject to change)
###

**jazz.bs** is a re-do of a site I made with **really** messy code (found inside the `earlyver/` folder; you can see it by clicking [here](http://lkprod3.github.io/jazz.bs/earlyver/)), this time focusing on a more responsive design rather than adapted by implementing the following:
  * Bootstrap v4
  * Cleaner HTML and CSS
  * Better use of custom styles
  * Proper jQuery and Javascript
    * Mainly for Scrollspy and animations

Layout and wireframing have been based on [this Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/gZxGM3MBrITtwrkJdxgysMhb/Wireframe?node-id=136%3A616).



## To-do
- [x] **Insert Bootstrap into the project**
- [ ] **Get a proper name and logo**
- [ ] Finish Homepage (basis for all the rest)
  - [x] Fix Carousel resizing in homepage at smaller resolutions
  - [ ] Edit scrolled images to ensure consistent height
  - [ ] Fix navbar/menu colors
  - [ ] Insert missing images/containers
- [ ] Finish the main content of the site
- [ ] Figure out a way to insert a footer into the site
- [ ] Add some sort of input to implement cookies
- [ ] **Properly resize content to smaller devices through** `style_bs.css`
