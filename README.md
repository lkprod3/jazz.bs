**jazz.bs** is a re-do of a site I made with **really** messy code (found inside the `earlyver/` folder; you can see it by clicking [here](http://lkprod3.github.io/jazz.bs/earlyver/)), this time focusing on a more responsive design rather than adapted by implementing the following:
  * Bootstrap v4.1
  * Cleaner HTML and CSS
  * Proper usage of custom HTML/CSS classes
  * Proper jQuery and Javascript

Layout and wireframing have been based on [this Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/gZxGM3MBrITtwrkJdxgysMhb/Wireframe?node-id=136%3A616).



## To-do
- [x] **Insert Bootstrap into the project**
- [x] **Get a proper name and logo**
- [x] Finish Homepage (basis for all the rest)
  - [x] Fix Carousel resizing in homepage at smaller resolutions
  - [x] Fix header colors
  - [x] Insert missing images/containers
- [x] Finish the main content of the site
- [x] Edit scrolled images to ensure consistent height
- [x] Figure out a way to insert a footer into the site
- [x] Add some sort of input to implement cookies
- [x] **Properly resize content to smaller devices through** `style_bs.css`
  <br>&nbsp;*Seems to be working at the moment, but might need some checking later on*
- [ ] Fix issues with carousel on different screen sizes
- [ ] Add artists into a carousel leading into other pages
